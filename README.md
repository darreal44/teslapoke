Playing with a Tesla Model S 100D from 2017 with an upgraded MCU2

## Tesla Security Researcher Program
Before I touched my car at all, I registered as part of the Tesla bug bounty program and my car is a research-registered vehicle. 
If you’re interested in poking at your car at all, I’d highly recommend registering as Tesla will try to fix it if you brick your car.

> If, through your good-faith security research, you (a pre-approved, good-faith security researcher) cause a software issue that requires your research-registered vehicle to be updated or “reflashed,” as an act of goodwill, Tesla shall make reasonable efforts to update or “reflash” Tesla software on the research-registered vehicle by over-the-air update, offering assistance at a service center to restore the vehicle’s software using our standard service tools, or other actions we deem appropriate.

I will put there every references I used or read related to this work:
- [Tristan Rice work on Tesla model 3](https://fn.lc/post/tesla-model-3) (many links in his work too I readed some before reading him too)

## A beginning

I bought an adapter with a Fakra connector to ethernet from Maxwell Autotech: [Tesla service cable ethernet FakraHSD for toolbox](https://maxwellautotech.com/product/tesla-service-cable-ethernet-fakrahsd-for-toolbox-1-5ft-model-sx/).
I removed the small box under the screen by pushing it hard to the bottom (There are clips is to put back by pushing up)
